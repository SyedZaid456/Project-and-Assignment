	<h2>What are my favourite hobbies</h2>
	<p>So on this page I am creating a landing page for my favourite hobbies. I would also explain those hobbies on this page. So My favourite hobbies are cycling, swimming (that I don't know).
	I would also want to learn horse riding as per my father's instructions. I don't know it yet. So let us cut the slack in that regards. So I love to watch <a href="E:\Presentation website\images\movies.html">movies</a> which would be presented on the landing page later.</p>
	<p><ol><h1><li>Cycling (And why do I love it)</li></h1> 
		<p>
		So <a href="https://www.cyclingnews.com/">cycling</a> is something that tones your muscles. 
		(For more information click the link in the discription above).It helps you attain a shape that is great. And keeps your mind Healthy and active. What more, it can always be a great physical booster as well. During my time in London; I did ride for quite a few hours and did well (MashAllah). Also, it is very relaxing and soothing for your body as well.
		</p>
		<h1><li>Swimming(And what it does)</li></h1>
		<p> <a href="https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/">Swimming</a> is something that every one loves doing. It is the best exercise for body and helps you maintain a good shape. People who swim are very comfortable on the outset in everything that they do or whatever decision they might take and easily achieve their daily tasks. It is a full body exercise. And can help in muscle retention. It can also help maintain a good mental health. 
		Tidbit: Toddlers when put into water can swim requiring little to no help at all. (Just for fun sakes.)  
		</p>
		<h1><li>Cricket</li></h1>
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/">Cricket</a> is not mainly a national sport for Pakistan but definitely has attained that status owing to some massive achievements by the team in this particular sport. People are very emotional when it comes to watching cricket. Also, the win and loss expectancy has made Cricket a special yet a very grounded, modest (for the crowd and players) and a balanced sport with no scope of brawls and fights, as seen in the other sports. Making it truly a Gentleman's sport.
